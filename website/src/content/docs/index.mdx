import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://lazyjj.dev/install.sh | bash
```

Requires [Jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup/) to be installed first.

## Problems We Solve

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Git rebases are error-prone" icon="warning">
    JJ's automatic rebasing handles descendant commits when you edit history.
    No more rebase conflicts from merge commits.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Graphite metadata breaks" icon="error">
    JJ's native stacking is built into the VCS itself. No external metadata
    files to corrupt or sync issues to debug.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI coding creates messy history" icon="puzzle">
    Claude Code integration uses isolated workspaces. AI changes stay contained
    until you're ready to merge.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why LazyJJ?

Jujutsu (JJ) is powerful but requires configuration. **LazyJJ gives you a complete stacked workflow out of the box.**

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Ship Faster with Stacked PRs" icon="list-format">
    Navigate and manage stacks with `stack-view`, `stack-top`, `stack-sync`.
    Create and update stacked PRs with a single command.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Pair Programming Ready" icon="rocket">
    Streamlined worktree management for Claude Code. Isolated workspaces prevent
    AI from disrupting your main work. AI-assisted conflict resolution included.
  </Card>
  <Card title="GitHub Without Third Parties" icon="github">
    Create stacked PRs directly with GitHub CLI. Auto-generate stack summaries
    in PR descriptions. No external service dependency or metadata sync issues.

    Pre-configured colors, pager settings, and UI tweaks. Revset aliases for
    trunk, stack, and stacks. Shortcuts for common operations ready to use.
