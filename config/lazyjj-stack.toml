# LazyJJ Stack Workflow
# https://lazyjj.dev
#
# Commands for working with stacks of commits.
# A "stack" is the set of commits from where you branched off trunk to your current position.
#
# Stack Workflow Overview:
#   1. jj stack-start         - Begin fresh work from trunk
#   2. Make changes, jj new-commit, repeat
#   3. jj bookmark-create <name> - Create a bookmark for the PR
#   4. jj stack-submit            - Push your stack to remote
#   5. jj stack-sync          - Fetch updates and rebase your stack

# VIEW STACKS
# =============================================================================

# stack-view - View your current stack of commits
# What: Shows all commits in your stack along with trunk for context.
# When: Use frequently to visualize your work and its relationship to trunk.
# Usage: jj stack-view
stack-view = ["log", "-r", "trunk::stack"]

# stack-files - View stack with file changes listed
# What: Shows stack commits with a summary of changed files per commit.
# When: Use to see which files each commit in your stack touches.
# Usage: jj stack-files
stack-files = ["log", "-r", "trunk::stack", "-s"]

# stacks-all - View all your work-in-progress stacks
# What: Shows all mutable commits you've authored across all branches.
# When: Use to see all your unfinished work, not just current stack.
# Usage: jj stacks-all
stacks-all = ["log", "-r", "stacks"]

# stacks-all-files - View all stacks with file changes
# What: Shows all your stacks with file change summaries.
# When: Use to audit all your in-progress work with file details.
# Usage: jj stacks-all-files
stacks-all-files = ["log", "-r", "stacks", "-s"]

# =============================================================================
# NAVIGATE STACK
# =============================================================================

# stack-top - Jump to the top of your stack
# What: Edits the head commit of your stack.
# When: Use to return to the top after editing commits lower in the stack.
# Usage: jj stack-top
stack-top = ["edit", "heads(stack)"]

# stack-bottom - Jump to the bottom of your stack
# What: Edits the first commit in your stack (stack_base).
# When: Use to work on the earliest commit in your stack.
# Usage: jj stack-bottom
stack-bottom = ["edit", "stack_base"]

# =============================================================================
# STACK MAINTENANCE
# =============================================================================

# stack-gc - Garbage collect empty commits in stack
# What: Abandons empty commits in your stack.
# When: Use after squashing or when empty commits accumulate.
# Usage: jj stack-gc
stack-gc = ["abandon", "empty() & stack"]

# stack-rebase - Rebase your stack onto trunk
# What: Rebases the entire current stack onto the latest trunk.
# When: Use after fetching to integrate upstream changes.
# Usage: jj stack-rebase
stack-rebase = ["rebase", "-s", "stack_base", "-d", "trunk"]

# =============================================================================
# BOOKMARK MANAGEMENT
# =============================================================================

# bookmark-tug - Move a bookmark to follow your work
# What: Moves the current bookmark to point at @- (parent commit).
# When: Use after jj new-commit to keep your bookmark pointing at your latest described commit.
# Usage: jj describe -m "feature"; jj new-commit; jj bookmark-tug
bookmark-tug = ["bookmark", "move", "--to", "@-"]

# bookmark-create - Create a new bookmark at @-
# What: Creates a named bookmark pointing at your previous commit (@-).
# When: Use to create a PR branch name for your work.
# Usage: jj bookmark-create my-feature
#        jj bookmark-create fix/bug-123
bookmark-create = ["bookmark", "create", "--to", "@-"]

# =============================================================================
# PUSH TO REMOTE
# =============================================================================

# stack-submit - Smart Stack push
# What: Pushes all commits in your stack to remote, allowing new branches.
# When: Use to push your stack for code review.
# Usage: jj stack-submit
stack-submit = ["git", "push", "-r", "stack", "--allow-new"]

# =============================================================================
# SYNC WORKFLOWS
# =============================================================================

# stack-sync - Fetch from remote and rebase your stack
# What: Combines git fetch and stack-rebase into one command.
# When: Use regularly to stay up-to-date with trunk.
# Usage: jj stack-sync
stack-sync = ["util", "exec", "--", "sh", "-c", "jj git fetch && jj rebase -s stack_base -d trunk"]

# stack-start - Begin fresh work from trunk
# What: Fetches latest changes and creates a new commit on trunk.
# When: Use to start a new feature or bug fix from a clean slate.
# Usage: jj stack-start
